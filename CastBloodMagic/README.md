## Installing
Copy the macro into any macro slot. When you cast a spell simply activate the macro from the hotbar.

## Usage
The macro launches a window where you can choose what level of spell you need to pay for. 
Additionally you can chose to spend a blood point to reduce the cost by 3. 
By default a chat message is sent and your character sheet is updated. 
Either of these options can be disabled for each activation.
